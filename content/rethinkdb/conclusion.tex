\section{Conclusion}

RethinkDB is a highly potential database with many use cases and some valuable customers. Being consolidated under the Linux Foundation, this potential might be more furthered and current problems, like the performance issues reduced. In this future, the lack of documented community drivers will hopefully evaporate and more and more third libaries will be added to RethinkDB.  Even though the namespacing, with just the \textit{r}, might be strange to use at first but due to the query chainability, it's many functions and the changefeed make up a lot for the uncertainty resulted in shut down and revival. RethinkDB's easiness in usability and installation-wise, it's simple web interface and the well-elaborated documentation are reason enough to give it a shot.

To synthesize it, RethinkDB is worth considering for web \& app projects alike especially if real time support is needed.
